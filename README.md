powermail-mail-migration
========================

Import mails from TYPO3 powermail extension v1.x into v2.x

Powermail 2.x has a form converter that converts the form itself, but cannot migrate the mails that were already submitted using the form. This script attempts to fill that hole.

To use:
* Update powermail to version 2.x
* Use the converter integrated in powermail to migrate the forms themselves to the new version
* Clone the repository
* Run `git submodule init` and `git submodule update` to fetch NotORM, or download it manually from http://www.notorm.com/ into the `notorm` subfolder
* Edit import.php:
  * Insert the TYPO3 database connection settings into the PDO instanciation
  * Fill $formMap with key-value pairs mapping the IDs of the forms in the powermail 1.x databases to the IDs of the new forms generated by the import wizard earlier
* Run import.php
